# Simple Calculator

This is a simple calculator program written in Go that performs basic arithmetic operations. The program takes two numbers and an operator as input and displays the result of the operation.

## Features

- **Addition**: `+`
- **Subtraction**: `-`
- **Multiplication**: `*`
- **Division**: `/` (with error handling for division by zero)

## Prerequisites

- Go (Golang) installed on your machine.

## How to Run

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:
   ```bash
   cd <project-directory>
   ```

3. **Run the Program**:
   ```bash
   go run main.go
   ```

4. **Input**:
   - **First Number**: Enter the first floating-point number.
   - **Second Number**: Enter the second floating-point number.
   - **Operator**: Enter the arithmetic operator (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`).

5. **Output**:
   - The result of the operation will be displayed in the format:
     ```
     <num1> <operator> <num2> = <result>
     ```

   - In case of division by zero, the program will display an error message:
     ```
     Error: Division by zero is not allowed!
     ```

   - If an invalid operator is entered, the program will display an error message:
     ```
     Error: Invalid operation entered!
     ```

## Example

```
Input:
First number: 10
Second number: 5
Operator: /

Output:
10.00 / 5.00 = 2.00
```
